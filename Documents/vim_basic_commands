There are three modes in the vim

1. Normal mode
	1. Escape button is used for going back to the normal mode
	2. :<vim command> 		eg : set number, set relativenumber, set shiftspace, set number!
	3. :!<normal bash commands> 	eg : ls,pwd
2. Insert mode
	1. You have to be in normal mode to shift to the insert mode 
	2. insert before the cursor		-- i 
	3. insert after the cursor  		-- a
	4. insert below line after the cursor	-- o  
3. Visual mode
	1. visual normal mode	-- v
	2. visual line mode	-- shift + v
	3. visual block mode	-- 

some short cuts you need to know

:/<word to find> ----  n to find the next word N to go back to the previous word

:%s/<character you want to replace>/<character to be replaced >/g
you can use the above command using visula mode also

:reg shows the content in the register

in vim we have something called as macro it is similar to registers which helps us to store some set of commands
